ENG:

Optimal Double Loop Networks or Circulant topologies (N;1,S) with minimum diameter for different nodes : 
resXt-2.csv with X thousands of nodes (X = 1 - 50)

CSV files format:

 N; Dlim; diam; s1opts

 where:

N - nodes count (order of graph) N;

Dlim - Exact lower bound of diameter; 

diam - optimal Diameter;

s1opts - optimal generator s <= N/2
