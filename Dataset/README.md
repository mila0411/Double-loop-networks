ENG:

The datasets are lists of Optimal Double Loop Networks or Circulant topologies of the form C(N;1,s) with the minimum diameter for different number of nodes : 
where file resXt-2.csv is a list of graphs with X thousands of nodes (X = 1 - 50)

CSV files format:

 N; lb; diam; s

 where:

N - number of nodes (order of a graph);

lb - exact lower bound of diameter; 

diam - optimal (minimal) diameter of a graph;

s - optimal generator (2 <= s <= N/2)

 About:

Additional information about the dataset is presented in the following article.
