ENG:

Optimal Double Loop Networks or Circulant topologies (N;1,S) with minimum diameter for different nodes : 
resXt-2.csv with X thousands of nodes (X = 1 - 50)

CSV files format:
nodes count (order of graph) N; Exact lower bound of diameter Dlim; Diameter diam; optimal generator s <= N/2 - s1opts

 N; Dlim; diam; s1opts
