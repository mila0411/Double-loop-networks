ENG:

1. The datasets in files resXt-2.csv are lists of Optimal Double Loop Networks or Circulant topologies of the form C(N;1,s) with the minimum diameter for different number of nodes : 
where file resXt-2.csv is a list of graphs with X thousands of nodes (X = 1 - 50)

CSV files format:

 N; lb; diam; s

 where:

N - number of nodes (order of a graph);

lb - exact lower bound of diameter; 

diam - optimal (minimal) diameter of a graph;

s - optimal generator (2 <= s <= N/2)


2. Dataset in file "optimal families 1791.pdf": Fragment of a dataset of optimal families with the minimum diameter, with an analytical description and scalable parameters of $L$-shaped templates (format: $\{d_m,P,\{N,s_2\},\{\{a_1,a_0\},\{b_1,b_0\},\{p_1,p_0\},\{q_1,q_0\}\}\} $). The fragment contains 1791 families that exist on diameters $d = d_m + k*P$ and, accordingly, for which $k=1, 2, 3, ...$. The list includes for the presented families the values $d_m$, $P$, polynomials in $d$ for vertices $N$, polynomials for the parameter $s_2$, coefficients of powers $d$ for parameters $a$, $b$, $p$, $q $.
 
3.  The dataset in file "circ-opt-min-aver-dist-5-4100.csv" are list of Optimal Double Loop Networks or Circulant topologies of the form C(N;1,s) with the minimum average distance for different number of nodes : 
CSV files format:
 N - number of nodes (order of a graph), s - optimal generator (2 <= s <= N/2), D - diameter, AD - average distance.

4.  The dataset in file "circ-ideal-min-diam-aver-dist-5-4100.csv" are list of ideal Double Loop Networks or Circulant topologies of the form C(N;1,s) with the minimum diameter and average distance for different number of nodes : 
CSV files format:
 N - number of nodes (order of a graph), s - optimal generator (2 <= s <= N/2), D - diameter, AD - average distance.

5. The dataset in file "dataset-circ-ideal-families-1756-1.csv" are list of optimal families by the average distance with an analytical description for graphs C(N; {1 , s2}), (entry format: {dm, P, {N,s2}}, ). The fragment contains 1756 families that exist on diameters d = dm + k*P  for which k=0, 1, 2 , 3, .... The list includes the values ​​dm, P, for the presented families, and {N,s2} are polynomials in $d$ for the number of vertices $N$ and polynomials for the parameter s2.

6. The dataset in file "dataset-circ-ideal-scalab-families-869.txt" are list of ideal families with an analytical description and scalable parameters of $L$-shaped templates
(format: $\{d_m,P,\{N,s_2\},\{\{a_1,a_0\},\{b_1,b_0\},\{p_1,p_0\},\{q_1,q_0\}\}\} $). The fragment contains 869 families that exist on diameters $d = d_m + k*P$ and, accordingly, for which $k=1, 2, 3, ...$. The list includes for the presented families the values $d_m$, $P$, polynomials in $d$ for vertices $N$, polynomials for the parameter $s_2$, coefficients of powers $d$ for parameters $a$, $b$, $p$, $q$.
