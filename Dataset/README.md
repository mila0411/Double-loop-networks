ENG:

The datasets are lists of Optimal Double Loop Networks or Circulant topologies of the form C(N;1,s) with the minimum diameter for different number of nodes : 
where file resXt-2.csv is a list of graphs with X thousands of nodes (X = 1 - 50)

CSV files format:

 N; lb; diam; s

 where:

N - number of nodes (order of a graph);

lb - exact lower bound of diameter; 

diam - optimal (minimal) diameter of a graph;

s - optimal generator (2 <= s <= N/2)


About dataset of optimal families 1791.pdf: Fragment of a dataset of optimal families with an analytical description and scalable parameters of $L$-shaped templates (format: $\{d_m,P,\{N,s_2\},\{\{a_1,a_0\},\{b_1,b_0\},\{p_1,p_0\},\{q_1,q_0\}\}\} $). The fragment contains 1791 families that exist on diameters $d = d_m + k*P$ and, accordingly, for which $k=1, 2, 3, ...$. The list includes for the presented families the values $d_m$, $P$, polynomials in $d$ for vertices $N$, polynomials for the parameter $s_2$, coefficients of powers $d$ for parameters $a$, $b$, $p$, $q $.
